How It Works ->
Initial User Input: The system engages the user in a conversational manner, asking for details like their budget, travel dates, destination, starting location, and the purpose of their trip.

Input Refinement: Through a series of follow-up prompts, the AI gathers additional information such as dietary preferences, specific interests (e.g., food, history, adventure), walking tolerance, and accommodation style. This ensures the itinerary is uniquely tailored.

Web Search Integration: Relevant attractions and activities are curated using web search or pre-fetched data, aligning with the refined user inputs.

Itinerary Generation: Finally, the application organizes the selected activities into a logical, day-by-day itinerary, balancing sightseeing, relaxation, and cultural immersion for the entire duration of the trip.
